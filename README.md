# RC car project

## Overview

A fast, light remote controlled car meant for my development in electronics.

## Why?

I needed a project to do since I finished my other one. This seemed like a suitable learning experience. This is just a stepping stone to more complex projects.  
Also, I like cars.

## Features

As of now I haven't made it, but I want it to
* be controlled remotely
* turn fast
* control its speed
* differential turning system (ackermann steering)
* suspension (double wishbone)

I don't think that's much to ask for as this is a beginner level project. I think all the challenge will be in the turning system.

## Materials

## Findings
For suspensions, suspension calculators are used to determine sag (how much the suspension compresses under weight of actual car), calculating spring rates to determine what stiffness/rate is needed for the load it will bear
It aslso evaluates "suspension geometry" essentially you can design how your geometry is placed according to your center of gravity to compensate for things like squat or dive. Squat and dive happen during acceleration and deceleration. squat is when your lower suspension goes down, this is during the acceleration phase. Dive would be vice versa. I have a screenshot of a video that explained it to me

### 15.12.25
I learned about differential turning systems, double wishbone suspension's capability of inducing beneficial negative camber when turning a corner. I was able to learn about the ackermann steering system, but not to the level where I understand the mechanics or physics of it. All I know is that the ackermann steering system makes the outer wheel turn more, as well as has the need for a 4 wheel drive differential.
