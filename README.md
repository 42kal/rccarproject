# RC car project

## Overview

A fast, light remote controlled car meant for my development in electronics.

## Why?

I needed a project to do since I finished my other one. This seemed like a suitable learning experience. This is just a stepping stone to more complex projects.  
Also, I like cars.

## Features

As of now I haven't made it, but I want it to
* be controlled remotely
* turn fast
* control its speed
* differential turning system (ackermann steering)
* suspension (double wishbone)

I don't think that's much to ask for as this is a beginner level project. I think all the challenge will be in the turning system.

## Materials

## Findings
For suspensions, suspension calculators are used to determine sag (how much the suspension compresses under weight of actual car), calculating spring rates to determine what stiffness/rate is needed for the load it will bear
